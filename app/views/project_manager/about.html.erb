<div class="fallback-message">
    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>

    Now that's the core element used by impress.js.

    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.

    You probably won't need it now, but there are some configuration options that can be set on this element.

    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).

    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective

    But as I said, you won't need it for now, so don't worry - there are some simple but interesing things
    right around the corner of this tag ;)

<div id="impress">

    <!--

        Here is where interesting thing start to happen.

        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.

        Positioning information is passed through data attributes.

        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.

        It will not be rotated or scaled.

    -->
    <div id="bored" class="step slide" data-x="-1000" data-y="-1500">
        <q>Aren't you just <b>bored</b> with all those slides-based presentations?</q>
    </div>

    <!--

        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.

        So in the example below it'll be `step-2`.

        The hash part of the url when this step is active will be `#/step-2`.

        You can also use `#step-2` in a link, to point directly to this particular step.

        Please note, that while `#/step-2` (with slash) would also work in a link it's not recommended.
        Using classic `id`-based links like `#step-2` makes these links usable also in fallback mode.

    -->
    <div class="step slide" data-x="0" data-y="-1500">
        <q>Don't you think that presentations given <strong>in modern browsers</strong> shouldn't <strong>copy the limits</strong> of 'classic' slide decks?</q>
    </div>

    <div class="step slide" data-x="1000" data-y="-1500">
        <q>Would you like to <strong>impress your audience</strong> with <strong>stunning visualization</strong> of your talk?</q>
    </div>

    <!--

        This is an example of step element being scaled.

        Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this
        element will be 4 times larger than the others.
        From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
        down (4 times) to make it back to it's correct size.
