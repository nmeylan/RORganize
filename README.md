## So it's a n+1 project management application?
I hope not. I have used several project management tools before write RORganize and I've always find them too much complex. Indeed, these tools often have a lots of menu/features that we don't use everyday.
I built RORganize with the principle to make an ergonomic tool. I always take care of performances, so I spend lots of time on refactoring to gain precious _ms_.
