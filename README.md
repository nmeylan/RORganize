# Overview

RORganize is a web application based on Ruby on Rails framework.
RORganize was inspired by the project manager application: Redmine.

RORganize is a bugs and issue-tracking app, which integrate additional tools such as:

### Project creation
	You can easily create your project, add members and their role(PM, dev), versions. You can also set up all you need for your project as plugins activation, or which tracker you need for your project issues.
	
### Issue creation
	You can either create your requests with the minimum of information(title) or with a maximum of detail(starting date, required task..).
	Your issues are created for a defined project, thus it is really easy to retrieve what you want. 
	To browse requests, you can create your custom filters and save them (and share them to your team mate).
	
### Scenario creation 
	The scenarios creation allows you to write your use cases story, detail each step and create/associate issues linked with your scenario. 
	
### Wiki pages for each project
	
### Projects activities tracking
	In a simple page you can retrieve all activities of your project. 
	
### Gantt
	As issues can be set with precise informations, application can generate an effective gantt for each version of your project.
	
### Simply roles and permissions management
