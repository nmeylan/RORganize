# What is RORganize?

RORganize is an easy to use and flexible project management and collaborative work application.

RORganize is [open source](https://github.com/nmeylan/RORganize) and released under [GNU GPL v3.0](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

A [demo](http://demo.rorganize.org/) instance is available.

## Getting started

## What makes RORganize a flexible tool

RORganize is flexible because it has been designed around the concept of modules. Each main feature (issues, documents, wiki, Gantt chart..) is a module.
Developers can also develop new feature inside a [Rails engine](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) without altering the core application, see [wiki page : plugins](https://github.com/nmeylan/RORganize/wiki/Plugins).

Users with granted permission can enable or disable those feature for their projects in a click.

In addition, users with granted permission can define roles and set permissions, for each actions available in the application, in a click.

## RORganize main feature

*   Multi databases support (MySQL, PostgresSql, Sqlite)
*   Multi projects support.
*   Flexible Bugs, issues and tasks tracking.
*   Flexible and sharable filters.
*   Enriched text editor (same as [github flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)).
*   Flexible permissions and roles management.
*   Wiki for each project.
*   Modules management : enable/disable feature for your project in a click.
*   Clear projects/users activities feed.
*   Documents upload.
*   Gantt chart editor.
*   Road map
*   Email/In app notifications.
*   Flexible core application. It's really easy to make and mount a plugin to the core app.
*   And more in progress...
